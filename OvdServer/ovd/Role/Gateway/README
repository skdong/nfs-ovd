The Gateway role does NOT work on these versions of Python machine:
 *  >= 3.0           (no compatibility with 3.0 Python language and API)
 *  < 2.6            (multiprocessing incompatibility)
 *  2.7.1 and 2.7.2  (multiprocessing incompatibility with 'recvfd' and 'sendfd')

OVDServer Gateway need a certificate located to fpem directory :


Generate key and CSR

First up is to create a certificate key and a certificate signing request (CSR). This can be done with OpenSSL.

apt-get update
apt-get install openssl

# replace bold type with your info
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out www_example_com.csr -keyout www_example_com.key -subj "/C=US/ST=Arizona/L=Scottsdale/O=Example Company Inc./CN=www.example.com"

Submit the CSR

The above will generate two files, www_example_com.key and www_example.com.csr.

Once you have signed up for an authoritatively signed certificate, you will be requested to upload the CSR file or its contents.

Verify the request

The signing authority will need to verify the validity of the request and that it was submitted by the entity to which the domain in the request is registered, usually done by contacting the administrative contact for the domain.

Further steps may be required when requesting an Extended Validation (EV) certificate, which color the address bar green in recent browsers.

Download signed certificate

After validation, your signed certificate (crt) will be available for download. Most likely your signing authority will include an intermediate CA certificate bundle (trust chain).

Note: you should make a backup of all SSL related files.

Generate PEM and placement

Generate the pem from the key and crt

cat www_example_com.key www.example.com.crt > cert.pem

Place the generated pem and intermediate bundle (eg. bundle.crt) in pem directory, and make them read-only to root.

chown root:root *.pem *.crt
chmod 400 *pem *.crt
