* 099_ulteo_kiosk.patch:
  Create a kiosk mode based on the Xfce one in gtkfilechooser to allow/forbid
  browsing of the file system. It's still a bit rough but works.

  TODO:
    - hide the File System link in the shortcuts
    - don't use a hardcoded path for the kioskrc file
    - move some code from gtkfilechooserutils to glib?
    - find a nicer solution to try and push the idea upstream :)
