This package installs the necessary components to the module High Availability Session Manager.

It is based on DRBD and hearbeat, it will install the Web module management business module HA Ulteo Session Manager.

1) DRBD

DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) is an open-source tool that lets you synchronize (through replication) storage devices (hard disk, partition, logical volume, etc..) Between two computers over the network.

This synchronization is done:

    * Real time: it is broadcast, while the data is changed
    * Transparently, so applications that record their data on the replicated storage device, do not even know that this is a special unit of storage.
    * Synchronously or asynchronously: in synchronous operation, the writing is declared over when the data are written locally AND the synchronization is complete. Operating asynchronous writing is declared
    
A virtual disk image (VBD) is designed to synchronize the MySQL database of Session Manager and it is transparent to the system administrator. You will find this binary /etc/ulteo/ovd/ha/vbd0.bin

The server synchronizes the data with a SHA1 key that you give to the facility that will generate a configuration file resource /etc/drbd.d/sm0.res This key will be used as well for communication between servers heartbeat (/etc/ha.d/authkeys).

2) Heartbeat
Heartbeat can manage different services High Availability (High Availability: HA) within a cluster of two session manager. Open-source, monitor the services necessary for the latter. It will fall when a session manager for one reason or another that the slave SQL database containing the replicated take over. The session manager is contacted via a virtual IP address, one IP for the relay is done transparently to the user. A new script OCF was established to eliminate bugs OCF script: mysql incompatible with version 5.1 of MySQL server (/usr/lib/OCF/resource.d/heartbeat/mysql-Ulteo).

3) /etc/init.d/ulteo_ha
Init script which performs losetup command, mount /dev/loop0 to the file vbd0.bin (for DRBD)
It disable mysql and apache on start
START PRIORITY : must be started at last
END   PRIORITY : must be end at last

4) HAshell
A program: HAshell is installed to execute commands as root ds needed to the web interface (/usr/bin/HAshell). Only the www-user can run this command (see configuration file /etc/ulteo-ovd.conf)

5) User Interface Shell
To use DRBD and Heartbeat command line interface, refer to the respective man page "drbdadm" and "crm".
